# Fetch Context Skill

Retrieve additional context from the platform to better understand the conversation.

## Usage

```bash
# Get recent messages
${HOME}/.agents/skills/fetch-context/scripts/fetch-context.ts \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --type recent_messages \
  --limit 20

# Search messages
${HOME}/.agents/skills/fetch-context/scripts/fetch-context.ts \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --type search_messages \
  --query "project deadline" \
  --limit 10
```

## Available Types

- `recent_messages`: Get more recent message history
- `search_messages`: Search for messages by keyword
- `user_info`: Get information about the current user

## Critical Rules

1. **Timeout**: The script won't run for more than 30 seconds. If it hangs, do stop_bash and retry ONCE. If it fails again, return an error message in JSON format.
